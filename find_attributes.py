# This script finds all attributes in a set of ADOC files
# Actually, it finds things that look like attributes, as in {something}
# So, of course, other things in curly brackets become false positives

# The script outputs the list to a file named attribute_list
# Every attribute (or not-really-attribute) is listed only once

# The script takes no parameters. To use this script:

# 1. Place this file into the root directory of your repository
# 2. Edit the list of directories a few lines below. Note: DO NOT add the _attributes directory
# 3. Run the script:
#     $ python find_attributes.py
# 4. Enjoy your attribute_list file
